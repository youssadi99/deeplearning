# Deep Learning (Apprentissage Profond)
Description: This repository contains demos, tutorials, and practical lab sessions (with solutions) covering key topics in deep learning. The materials are designed to support hands-on learning and provide implementations of fundamental and advanced deep learning concepts.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) â€“ Basics of deep learning, backpropagation, and multilayer perceptrons.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) â€“ Image processing, feature extraction, and popular architectures (e.g., LeNet, ResNet).

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) â€“ Sequential data processing, LSTMs, and GRUs.

Language Models â€“ Traditional and neural approaches to text modeling. Transformers â€“ Attention mechanisms, BERT, GPT, and modern NLP architectures.

Generative Models â€“

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) â€“ Image generation and adversarial training.

Autoencoders (AE) â€“ Dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) â€“ Probabilistic generative modeling.

ðŸ›  Contents Demos â€“ Interactive notebooks illustrating core concepts.

Labs (TPs) â€“ Practical coding exercises with solutions.

Datasets & Pre-trained Models â€“ Resources for training and experimentation. ðŸŽ¯ Audience Students and researchers learning deep learning.

Practitioners looking for ready-to-use implementations.

Educators seeking teaching materials for courses.
